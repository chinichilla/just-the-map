This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Konva] (https://konvajs.org/). A launched version of the application can be found on Heroku: https://just-the-map.herokuapp.com/.

### Inspiration

The inspiration comes from playing Dungeons & Dragons and going into an unknown area. My dungeon master (DM) put our maps into a vector graphics editor and put an opaque mask layer on top of any of the unkown maps.

### Setup

In the project directory, you can run:
`npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
