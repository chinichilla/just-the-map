This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Konva](https://konvajs.org/). A launched version of the application can be found on Heroku: https://just-the-map.herokuapp.com/.

### Inspiration

The inspiration comes from playing Dungeons & Dragons when we went into unknown areas, and my dungeon master (DM) put our maps into a vector graphics editor to conceal areas we hadn't explored yet.  An opaque mask layer was put on top of any of the unknown maps and slowly erased the explored areas throughout the session. The goal of this project is to give dungeon masters a collection of maps where they can save gameplay. I'm continuing it in the [dd-mapper repo](https://github.com/djchinia/dd-mapper).

### Setup

In the project directory, you can run:
`npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### How to Use

Right now, a hard-coded, background map can have a fixed grid and mask layer put on top. The mask can be erased, and players' names or icons can be dragged around on the canvas. 

### Next Steps

Follow the [dd-mapper repo](https://github.com/djchinia/dd-mapper) since I'm planning to build out most of the functionality there. The overall plan is something that looks like this:
